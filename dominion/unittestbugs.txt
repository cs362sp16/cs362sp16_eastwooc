The scoreFor() function doesn't correctly count victory/curse cards in the user's discard pile.
Using scavenger doesn't add the cost of the discarded card to the user's buy pool
Using remodel doesn't increase the discarded card count.  They may be added later after the card is played, so not sure if this is an actual bug.
